# Clothing-type-prediction

Artificial neural networks project based on moda_mnist, a clothing-type dataset of 60000 samples. There are 10 different types of clothing in the dataset. These clothes are 28 * 28 pixels in size and are given to the artificial neural network in black and white. In the last part of the code, 5 samples are randomly selected from the estimated data and displayed on your screen.
